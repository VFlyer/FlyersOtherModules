                        <p class="flavour-text">Wait... How many stages?! I thought you said there were only two to four!</p>
						<p>This module consists of a 4x4 grid, a binary counter of 5 LEDs, a green submit button, and a red reset button.</p>
						<p>To solve the module, solve the 4×4 Game of Life grid for each iteration. The rules for this game are different to the normal Game of Life.</p>
						<p>Cell birth, or when a black cell should turn into a white cell, depends on the top half of the grid. For every white cell in the top half, take its position in reading order. For example, if the columns are labeled A-D from left to right and rows are labeled 1-4 from top to bottom A1 would be a 1; C2 would be a 7. The values obtained indicate how many cells surrounding a black cell should be white, in order to turn said black cell white. Surrounding tiles to the specified tile are considered to be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to the specified tile, excluding wrap-around.</p>
						<p>Cell survival, or when a white cell should stay white, depends on the bottom half of the grid. For every white cell in the bottom half, take its position in reading order ignoring the top two rows. For example, if the columns are labeled A-D from left to right and rows are labeled 1-4 from top to bottom, A3 would be a 1, B4 would be a 6. These values indicate how many white cells should be adjacent a white cell for it to stay white. If it should not stay white turn it black.</p>
						<p>In addition, no cells get born or survive without any white neighbors. Cells outside of the 4x4 grid consist of black/dead cells, and cannot birth white/alive cells.</p>
						<p>The module will solve whenever the next calculated iteration was exactly the previously submitted iteration, or if the binary counter overflows. Overflowing the binary counter may take 32 iterations to submit correctly. Because it is possible to get an iteration seed that can eat a lot of time, instead of solving the module normally, the defuser can solve it instantly for the cost of a strike by breaking the status light. <strong>Breaking the status light before submitting 3 iterations correctly will also result in a strike but the module will still solve after submitting 3 iterations correctly.</strong></p>
