                <h2>On the Subject of Robit Programming</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Now it's your turn to distinguish between the mazes.</p>
                <p>On the module is a giant square which is the interface used for viewing the maze. Initially, the module will show a "Generate" button and a numeric display denoting how much delay the module generates its mazes.</p>
                <p>Pressing the "Generate" button will start creating the maze by carving out the giant square at a specified delay which can be customized for the defuser. The defuser can press the "Generate" button to generate a new maze until the defuser finds one that is sufficient. This also reveals a terminal for the robit that comes out of the center of the maze, which the defuser can input a series of 1's or 0's and can scroll the instruction sets with the up or down keys. The play/pause button on the terminal starts or pauses the robit from processing its command. The defuser will not be able to regenerate a maze or adjust the delay on how the maze is generated, so caution is in mind when pressing the play/pause button.</p>
				<p>To disarm the module, the defuser must figure out how the maze was generated, and the expert must modify the starting instructions to grab the combination of bits that tells the robit to move in a specific direction. The robit must be guided to the 4 corners of the provided quadrants, noted by the small square on each, and then move towards the center row/column of the maze to disarm the module. The four quadrants may also modify the robit's behavior when its corner has not been visited yet.</p>

                <h2>Step 1: Figuring Out How The Maze Was Generated</h2>
                <p>The maze generated from this module is random however how the maze generates can be predicted with repeated regenerations of that maze.</p>
				<p>For ease of access, a red cube is placed to point where the current position is during its corridor generating and checking procedures. This table consists of each algorithm used in this module and their respective descriptions on how the algorithm determines when generating a maze.</p>
				<table class="mazegen">
					<tr>
						<th>Maze Algorithm</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Backtracking Generator</td>
						<td>The simplest algorithm to understand and to implement. Creates mainly long winding corridors with few dead ends. If it finds no unvisited cells around itself, it will simply "backtrack" to the last cell and try to continue from there. The maze is considered generated if it backtracks to the starting cell and finds no unvisited cells around that area.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Binary Tree</td>
						<td>A crazily simple algorithm that can be used to generate simple mazes by only looking at one cell at a time. The maze generated has a strong diagonal bias alongside being skewed to a specified corner.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Hunt And Kill</td>
						<td>Creates mainly long winding corridors with few dead ends. If it finds no unvisited cells around itself, it will scan for any unvisited cells adjacent to at a visited cell and stop on the first one it finds. It will then continue generating the corridor by connecting that unvisited cell with a visited cell and resume normally like the Backtracking Generator. The maze is considered generated if there are no unvisited cells.</td>

                <h2>Step 2: Obtaining The Starting Instructions</h2>
                <p>Once the defuser has figured out how the maze was generated, the expert must then grab the set of starting instructions based on how the maze was generated. Certain mazes that are generated will have their respective biases noted in the table which may alter the starting instructions. In the table provided, "Up", "Down", "Left", and "Right" are all abbreviated as a single letter for that given direction in the bit pair as "U", "D", "L", "R" respectively.</p>
